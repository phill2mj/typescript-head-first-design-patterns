# Design Patterns in TypeScript
A TypeScript implementation of the exercises found at the end of each chapter in the
Head First Design Patterns book. I'll be updating periodically. If there is a UML that
means I'm done with that chapter.

## Getting Started

`yarn install`

#### Run inside VSCode
Open `index.ts` in the chapter you want to run, and start the debugger. Breakpoints should
work as expected

#### Run in a Terminal
Open a terminal window in the directory of the chapter you want to run
and invoke `ts-node index.ts`.
You may have to install ts-node globally for this to work.
